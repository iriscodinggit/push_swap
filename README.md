# Push_Swap Project

This project aims to sort a given set of integers using a predefined set of instructions and the least number of movements possible, utilizing two stacks. The goal is to implement a sorting algorithm that is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.

## Instructions

-The program uses two stacks to sort the integers.
-You are required to minimize the number of operations to achieve a sorted set.
-The operations allowed for the stacks are limited and must be executed in an optimal way.

## Getting Started

To test this project:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository:

`git clone <repository-url>`

2Ô∏è‚É£ Compile the project:

`make`

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the program: Execute the following command to sort a set of integers:

`./push_swap "1 2 0 3 5"`

Happy testing! üíó
